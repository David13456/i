<p>Welcome to the Begin to code with JavaScript web pages. The book will be published later this year by Pearson Press</p>

<p>This is a work in progress. I will be posting sample code and pages here as I write the book.</p>

<h2>Production Podcast</h2>
<p>I&quot;m recording a podcast and some screencasts for each chapter. You can hear me read out the text and also view some screencasts that help with some of the sections. 
  You can find all this here: <a href="https://robmiles.com/jspodcast">https://robmiles.com/jspodcast</a></p>

<h2>Pre-release Chapters</h2>
<strong>These are pre-release and their contents are very subject to change as we work on the book. New chapters will be added as the writing continues.</strong>

<ul>
  <li><a href="./chapters/Chapter 00 Introduction.pdf">Introduction</a></li>
  <li><a href="chapters/Chapter 01 Running JavaScript.pdf">Chapter 1 - Running JavaScript</a>  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Sample Code</h2>
<p>This is the sample code for the chapters. There are references to the examples in each chapter.</p>
