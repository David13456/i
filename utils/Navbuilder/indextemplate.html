<p>Welcome to the Begin to code with JavaScript web pages.</p>
<p>This is where I'm going to post any resources that I create for the book.</p>
<p>You can buy the book on Amazon <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Begin-Code-JavaScript-Rob-Miles/dp/0136870724">here</a></p>

<h2>Draft Podcast</h2>
<p>I recorded a podcast and some screencasts for the first six draft cchapters. You can hear me read out the text and also view some screencasts that help with some of the sections. 
You can find all this here: <a href="https://robmiles.com/jspodcast">https://robmiles.com/jspodcast</a>. If you want more, send me an email and ask. You never know....</p>

<h2>Sample Code</h2>
<p>This is the sample code for all the chapters. There are references to the examples in each chapter. Open each link to see the web page containing the example program. 
The games in Chapter 12 are quite fun, although you will need a device with a keyboard to play them properly. </p>
