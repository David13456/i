<p>Welcome to the Begin to code with JavaScript web pages. The book will be published later this year by Pearson Press</p>

<p>This is a work in progress. I will be posting sample code and pages here as I write the book.</p>

<h2>Production Podcast</h2>
<p>I&quot;m recording a podcast and some screencasts for each chapter. You can hear me read out the text and also view some screencasts that help with some of the sections. 
  You can find all this here: <a href="https://robmiles.com/jspodcast">https://robmiles.com/jspodcast</a></p>

<h2>Pre-release Draft</h2>
<strong>This text is pre-release and the contents are very subject to change as we work on the book. New chapters will be added as the writing continues.</strong>
<p>You can find the pre-release text here:
