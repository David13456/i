    This example works in exactly the same way as the previous one, but it uses overridden methods to make the code
    simpler.
    You can watch this in action by using the debugger to step through the calls of getDescription. Put a breakpoint on
    the first line of the
    getDescription method in the Dress class and then watch how the method calls the getDescription method in the
    StockItem parent
    to get the description of the parent object.

  <pre class="sampleCode">
myDress=new Dress(221,8,60,"Strapless evening dress","red","swirly",10);
myPants=new Pants(222,1,45,"Good for the workplace","black","plain",30,30);
console.log(myDress.getDescription());
console.log(myPants.getDescription());
